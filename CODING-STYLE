To ensure that the code, potentially coming from many developers,
remains understandable here are some brief notes on coding-style:

* No TABs in source files.
* No single-line "//" comments.
* Indentation is four spaces.
* Braces go on their own lines.

Run "make style" to test the code prior to committing any changes.

Example of good style:

        if ( foo )
        {
            ..
        }
        else
        {
            ...
        }

Example of bad style:

        if ( foo ) {
           ...
        } else {
           ...
        }
