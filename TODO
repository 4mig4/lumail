Once this list is empty we'll move to using the github issues.

If there are any issues found before this file is empty github
may still be used.

To make 0.05:

1. Wire up "is_unread()" "mark_read()" + "mark_new()" to lua.

BUG:  If index-view is set to limit only new messages and we mark it is read then
it will immediately disappear because it is no longer in the set of messages returned
by get_messsages().

Either a) add a special case, or b) add an explicit "write_folders()" function.


To make: 0.06:


Scrolling in large maildirs is slow because we re-read each message
we display.  (Max== screen height).  We should create persistant objects, or use a cache.


We should have a compose mode.  Use our MIME-parser to add attachments,
and pipe to /usr/bin/sendmail - use "sendmail()" to set the path/args.

NOTE: "compose()" primitive works, but just invokes vim on a temporary file, then deletes it.

NOTE: Could use the ncurses forms library?


To make: 0.07:

Add text-completion stuff to the input routine.

Read email addresses from ~/addressbook - or whatever pine/alpine/mutt use.
Do this in lua?  So you could exec lbdb?



Before we publish any debian packages
-------------------------------------

Reformat the code and use consistent function-names. (get_foo_bar()  vs.  setBar()).

Reformat the code, since indent has messed things up.

Double-check we're not leaking lua-stack objects.  Don't seem to be, and yet ..
