Once this list is empty we'll move to using the github issues.




Scrolling in large maildirs is slow because we re-read each message
we display.  (Max== screen height).  We should create persistant objects, or use a cache.



We need a simple "read message" routine.  We're using the MIME-parser
now so we should find that simple to extract the body.  (Be evil and only
expose the text/plain version of multi-part messages ;)

NOTE: See test/body.cc



We should have a compose mode.  Use our MIME-parser to add attachments,
and pipe to /usr/bin/sendmail - use "sendmail()" to set the path/args.

NOTE: "compose()" primitive works, but just invokes vim on a temporary file, then deletes it.



Reformat the code and use consistent function-names. (get_foo_bar()  vs.  setBar()).


Double-check we're not leaking lua-stack objects.  Don't seem to be, and yet ..
