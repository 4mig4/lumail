Once this list is empty we'll move to using the github issues.


To make 0.05:

1. Wire up "is_unread()" "mark_read()" + "mark_new()" to lua.

BUG:  If index-view is set to limit only new messages and we mark it is red then
it will immediately disappear because it is no longer in the set of messages returned
by get_messsages().
Either a) add a special case, or b) add an explicit "write_folders()" function.


2. We need a simple "read message" routine.  We're using the MIME-parser
now so we should find that simple to extract the body.  (Be evil and only
expose the text/plain version of multi-part messages ;)

NOTE: See test/body.cc



To make: 0.06:


Scrolling in large maildirs is slow because we re-read each message
we display.  (Max== screen height).  We should create persistant objects, or use a cache.


We should have a compose mode.  Use our MIME-parser to add attachments,
and pipe to /usr/bin/sendmail - use "sendmail()" to set the path/args.

NOTE: "compose()" primitive works, but just invokes vim on a temporary file, then deletes it.

NOTE: Could use the ncurses forms library?



Before we publish any debian packages
-------------------------------------

Reformat the code and use consistent function-names. (get_foo_bar()  vs.  setBar()).

Double-check we're not leaking lua-stack objects.  Don't seem to be, and yet ..
