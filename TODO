  The biggest outstanding issue is changing the MIME
 library, which is used for parsing, attachment handling,
 and (TODO) header-decoding/encoding.

  There are two parts of the code that need updating:

    src/message.cc
    src/message.h

  The header file has "TODO-MIME" in the places where changes
 need to be made.

  The second part that needs updating is the compositional
 code in src/binding.cc.  This is less important/difficult.
