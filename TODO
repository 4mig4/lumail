2.  Scrolling in large maildirs is slow because we re-read each message
   we display.  (Max== screen height).
    We should create persistant objects, or use a cache.

5.  We need a simple "read message" routine.  We're using the MIME-parser
   now so we should find that simple to extract the body.  (Be evil and only
   expose the text/plain version of multi-part messages ;)

7.  We should have a compose mode.  Use our MIME-parser to add attachments,
   and pipe to /usr/bin/sendmail - use "sendmail()" to set the path/args.
    NOTE: "compose()" primitive works, but just invokes vim on a temporary
   file, then deletes it.

8.  Reformat the code and use consistent function-names.  This is unfortunate:
       get_foo_bar().
     vs.
       setBar()

9. Double-check we're not leaking lua-stack objects.  Don't seem to be, and yet ..
