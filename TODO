The biggest outstanding issue which has hit release 0.1-0.17 has
been the inability to decode header-fields correctly.

We also failed to encode outgoing messages, just assumed they
were 8bit clean.

We've now made the decision to move to GMime for
all our MIME handling:

  * Header encoding/decoding
  * Attachment iteration, extraction, and addition.

This is being tracked in the following github bug:

  https://github.com/skx/lumail/issues/101

The code affected primarily lives in src/message.{cc h}, which is
where direct manipulation of messages happens.  There is a small
amount of code in src/bindings.cc which relates to adding
attachments to (outgoing) messages which also needs to be cleaned
up and ported though.

src/message.h has "TODO-MIME" in the places where changes need to
be made.
